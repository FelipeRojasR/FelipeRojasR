### Hello reader!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm a bioinformatician passionate about unveiling the hidden tales behind molecular data.

My journey started around 2017, delving into the captivaring world of molecular data analysis. Since then, my background spans across the intricate realms of genomics, transcriptomics and structural biology, while swimming across regression analysis and machine learning. As a result, I've contributed to research papers, student theses, a comprehensive review, and even a book chapter - a true testament of collaborative effort.

This GitHub space offers a glimpse into my coding adventures and data-crunching escapades. My toolkit including R, Python, a knack for Linux servers, and the power to wield SQL databases.

While you might wonder if I joined the GitHub party a bit later than others, rest assured, it's never too late. So whether you're a fellow bioinformatician, a curious mind, or just interested in the intricate world of molecular data, I hope you can find something here that sparks your next big idea.

Stay happy, stay data-driven!

Warmly,
ðŸŒ± Felipe.
