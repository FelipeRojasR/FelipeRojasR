### Hello reader!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm a bioinformatician passionate about unveiling the hidden tales in genetics.

My journey started around 2017, delving into the captivaring world of molecular data analysis. Since then, my background spans across genomics, transcriptomics and structural biology, while swimming using biostatistics. As a result, I've contributed to research papers, student theses, literature reviews and even a book chapter. All has been possible thanks to collaborative efforts.

This GitHub space offers a glimpse into my coding adventures and data-crunching escapades. My toolkit including R, Python, a knack for Bash, and the power of snakemake. So whether you're a fellow bioinformatician, a curious mind, or just interested in genetic data, I hope you can find something here that sparks your next big idea.

Warmly,

ðŸŒ± Felipe.
