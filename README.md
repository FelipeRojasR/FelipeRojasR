### Hello reader!

I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of GitHub. I'm a bioinformatician with a passion for unraveling the intricate stories hidden behind molecular data.

With a focus on molecular data analysis, my exploration of this captivating work began around 2017. Since then, my background spans across the intricate realms of genomics, transcriptomics and structural biology, while swimming across regression analysis and machine learning.

One rewarding aspects of my journey has been my participation in a myriad of scientific projects. As part of a collaborative force, I've lent my expertise to research papers, student theses, a comprehensive review, and even a book chapter, spanning a diverse array of disciplines.

Through this GitHub space, I aim to provide a glimpse into my coding adventures and data-crunching escapades with a toolkit including R, Python, a knack for Linux servers, and the power to wield SQL databases.

While you might wonder if I joined the GitHub party a bit later than others, rest assured, it's never too late. So whether you're a fellow bioinformatician, a curious mind, or just interested in the intricate world of molecular data, I hope you can find something here that sparks your next big idea.

Be happy and data-driven!

Warmly,
ðŸŒ± Felipe.
